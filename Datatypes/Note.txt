**Primitive datatypes** are the basic, built-in types in a programming language, like `int`, `char`, `float`, and `boolean`, which store simple values directly. 

**Non-primitive datatypes** (also known as reference types) are more complex types like objects, arrays, and strings, which store references to memory locations rather than the actual data. 

Primitive types are predefined by the language, while non-primitive types are created by the programmer.
